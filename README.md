# Store-Sales-Prediction-Using-ML-and-Python

Abstract: In this project on Store Sales Prediction using machine learning and Python, the objective is to forecast sales for various stores based on the available dataset features. Predictive analytics aids in identifying the key factors that influence future sales performance in retail stores, leveraging various machine learning algorithms to find the most suitable model for our problem. We applied standard regression methods along with boosting algorithms and observed that boosting techniques outperform regular regression in terms of results.

Introduction: Sales forecasting plays a vital role in modern business intelligence. It is often a complex issue, especially when dealing with insufficient data, missing entries, or outliers. Sales prediction is typically viewed as a regression problem rather than a time-series problem. Experience shows that regression methods often yield better results compared to time-series techniques. Machine learning algorithms help identify patterns within time series data, with supervised learning methods, particularly tree-based models, being highly effective in uncovering complex patterns in sales behavior.

Methodology: During initial data exploration, we observed that some stores were not open on certain days, which clarified that only active stores had sales data. Thus, we safely excluded inactive stores from the dataset. We discovered a clear correlation between customer count and sales by analyzing trends. By further breaking down data by day of the week, we confirmed that specific days had a stronger relationship with sales. Notably, there was no Easter holiday data among state holidays, complicating the prediction of sales during Easter. While promotions significantly influenced sales, school holidays had a smaller impact. We also identified that certain store types correlated more strongly with sales. Considering the dataset had many categorical variables, such as day, week, store type, and promotions, decision tree models were deemed appropriate to understand feature importance. The analysis showed that customer counts and average sales per customer were critical factors. By utilizing ensemble methods like AdaBoost and Random Forest, we achieved improvements of 0.0608 and 0.0599, respectively, on the validation set. Random Forests showed less variance compared to AdaBoost, and we further employed XGBoost for gradient-boosted trees to predict scores.

Results: AdaBoost sometimes outperformed Random Forest in terms of variance, but XGBoost produced the best overall results with the dataset. Interestingly, the features selected by XGBoost did not align with the rankings in other models. Metrics like average sales per month or day of the week did not contribute much to improvement, likely due to extrapolation on the test set, which led to overfitting. Ultimately, the prediction model provided store sales forecasts.
